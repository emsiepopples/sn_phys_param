=============

One piece of code for running SN analogue calculations.

Reading in 1 file, the code will output the ejecta mass, kinetic energy and nickel mass for a supernova based on any number of analogues.

Based on Arnett's equations, plus the equation for the nickel mass in Walker et al (submitted).
